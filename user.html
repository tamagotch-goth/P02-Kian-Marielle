        <h2>Space Futura Customers</h2>
            <p>At Space Futura we are selling items based off how the past imagined the future. We love the past, but we really love how the past imagine our future &#40;and the graphic design they used &#41;. Our customers are often 30+ history or sci-fi buffs - selfproclaimed "nerds", if you will. We want to meet peoples needs of cool retro space themed items, all while packaging everything in really cool retro designs.  </p>
