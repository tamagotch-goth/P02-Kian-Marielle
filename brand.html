            <h2>About Space Futura</h2>
            <p>Space Futura is about all things retro-futuristic. We sell antiques and memorabilia that have a blend of retro-styles and futuristic technology – think the Jetsons or even Katsuhiro Otomo’s Akira. We showcase how those of the past saw our future and revel in the inventive and zany technologies they imagined for us.</p>
            
            <h3>What We Sell</h3>
            <p>Antique retro-futuristic items, recreated retro toys, retro t-shirts and clothes, books, and posters (everything retro themed).</p>
            
            <h3>Selling Point</h3>
            <p> There are no shops like this on the internet. It’s a one of a kind shop, only rivaled by Esty shops. It consolidates all retro-futuristic items in one place. </p>
